# 6. Data Visualization

This module will cover: 

  - plotting in base R
  - plotting in ggplot
  
which will require the following skills already covered:

  - Read in Data
  - Manipulate Data structure 
  - assigning an object

We will also touch on choosing an appropriate visualization, interactive graphics, and maps. 

## Introduction

Data visualization in `R` can be quick and dirty (ie. data exploration for yourself) or highly polished (ie. communicating to others). We have already touched on quick data exploration in the third module yesterday. Today we will cover content to produce a more polished looking plot. 


## Two approaches to the same problem: Base `R` vs ggplot

Plotting in base `R` can allow the user to create highly customized plots. This customization comes at a cost- time.  

### Base R

#### Adding layers of data

#### Legends

#### Multipanel plots

### ggplot

#### plotly: easy interative plots with ggplot

## Graphic for communication

There are plenty of guides on how to create the "best" visualization.

If you're plotting data to communicate (which is normally the case), some things you should keep in mind:

  - every addition plot feature is adding additional information
  - color choice (connotation, color blind)
  - how the audience expects to see data
