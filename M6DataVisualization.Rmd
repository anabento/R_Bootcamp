# 6. Data Visualization

This module will cover:

  - Read in Data
  - Manipulate Data structure 
  - assigning an object
  - Plot in base R
  - Plot in ggplot

We will also touch on choosing a visualization.

## Two approaches to the same problem: Base R vs ggplot

### Base R

### ggplot

#### plotly: easy interative plots with ggplot

## Graphic for communication

There are plenty of guides on how to create the "best" visualization. 

If you're plotting data to communicate (which is normally always), some things you should keep in mind:

  - every addition plot feature is adding additional information
  - color choice (connotation, color blind)
  - how the audience expects to see data
