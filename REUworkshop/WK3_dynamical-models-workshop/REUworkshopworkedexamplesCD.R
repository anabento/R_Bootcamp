# dI <- beta*S*I*(1/N) - mu*I - gamma*I # assuming death rate for I is same as S. If additional mortality... call it 'v' and make the last term " - (v + mu)*I

### Deriving thresholds
################

#### R0 = beta/gamma (when proportion of susceptibles approximately equals the total population)
R0 <- params.e4a["beta"]/params.e4a["gamma"]
# Here, R0 = 2.1

#### When R0 > 1, a disease can spread through a population. When R0 < 1, diseases do not spread
#### To get R0 below 1... we need to make dI/dt negative
#### dI/dt = beta*S*I/N - gamma*I # assuming no mortality/birth
### 0 < beta*S*I/N - gamma*I # divide by I
### 0 < beta*S/N - gamma # when the population is almost entirely susceptible, S = N (approximately). So...
### 0 < beta - gamma
### So, with frequency-dependent transmission, a disease will increase if transmission is greater than recovery (makes some sense)

### Without altering the recovery or transmission rates (which is presumably hard for real systems), how do we make R0 less than 1?
### Let's break the assumption that everyone is susceptible
### If a fraction of the population is immune (or 'recovered' as we currently have things), S =/= N at the onset

### Then...
### 0 < beta*S/N - gamma
### gamma < beta*S/N
### gamma/beta <> S/N
### so, if the proportion of susceptibles (S/N) is greater than gamma/beta, a disease can increase
### if S/N < gamma/beta, it will decrease. Let's see that with the equations

### define the 'invasion threshold' as (1/R0) # convince yourself that that's the same as the proportion of susceptibles necessary for increase
invasion.threshold <- 1/R0

### and then convince yourself that 1- this quantity is the proportion of individuals you'd have to vaccinate for this particular disease
proportion.to.vaccinate <- 1 - (1/R0)

R0.e4b <- (params.e4a["beta"] * (xstart.e4b["S"])) / params.e4a["gamma"] ### because not all the population is susceptible, we adjust the equation for R0

points(I~time,data=out.e4c,type="b",ylab="I",xlab="time",col="blue") ### here, S/N was just smaller than the threshold (R0 = 0.966)
### So in this second panel (which is just zoomed in on the beginning of the first panel), we see that the 'just over the S/N threshold case does have some TINY increase (i.e. red dots compared to black line)
### But! the disease quickly dropped S/N below the threshold, which is why it decreases so quickly
### play around with the initial proportions of S and R and replot (just make sure to adjust your x and y limits with xlim=c(min,max) and ylim=c(min,max))

### Overall, increasing transmission increases the size of epidemics (because it also increases R0)
### Similarity, decreasing the recovery rate increases the size of epidemics (again, increases R0)
### The recovery rate is the reciprocal of the infectious period of the pathogen. So, when gamma = 1/7, the infectious period is 7 (days, or weeks, or whatever unit you are using)
### this is why, in the 'low recovery' scenario, we see a peak epidemic size ~0.4 (similar to the high transmission scenario),
#### BUT the duration of the epidemic is longer - because we've made the average infected individual stick around for longer (i.e. 14 'days' instead of '7')

### SIS model goes to an endemic equilibrium - as long as the infection is able to invade the population, then loss of immunity guarantees long term persistence. And not everyone will get infected!
### In fact, you already calculated the equilibrium proportion of susceptibles (can you think of what it is?)
tail(out.SIS)
### it's 1 - (1/R0) - because the pathogen only has positive growth up until this point
### and, because it's an SIS model, 1/R0 is the equilibrium prevalence. So with no recovery, about 47% of our simulated population would be infected with this simulated pathogen

  N <- S + I + R
  
  ### Note! The formulation that I went through in the disease workshop is not identical to the classical derivation
  ### Generally, the birth rate (b) is assumed a constant - i.e. it doesn't depend on the Susceptible population
  ### The constant (b) is akin to immigration from outside the population, rather than generation of new susceptibles from within
  ### It is illustrative to explore both forms; run the model with the same b and mu (birth and death values),
  ### but switch the 'birth term' between "b" to "b*S"
  ### What do you notice as the difference? When might one formulation be preferred to the other?
  
  dS <- (b) - (beta*S*I*(1/N)) - (mu*S)      ### or, dS <- (b*S) - (beta*S*I*(1/N)) - (mu*S)

#### Point is that, with births in the model, disease can come back when proportion of susceptibles becomes high enough again
#### but what's the new equilibrium number of susceptibles?
### long-term eq(S) should be ~ 1- (gamma+mu) /  beta:
abline(b=0,a=1-(((1/7)+0.01)/0.3)) 
### Essentially, things that remove infecteds (recovery, death) / things that add infecteds (transmission)


### So please mess around with the initial proportion of S, I, and R - see what happens! Change beta and gamma, and convince yourself that you can still calculate equilibria

    i <- s0 - s #calculate i_t+1 from s_t and and s_t+1 
    t <- t+1 #update time vector
    out <- rbind(out, c(t, s,i)) # appends the new row of data to the output matrix
    s0 <- s # use s to calculate new number of susceptibles in the simulation
  }
  
  end.time[k] <- out[dim(out)[1],1] ### each time the 'while loop' stops, take the last entry of the first column. In this case, that's the time when the epidemic stopped
}
hist(end.time,breaks=22)
mean(end.time)


### example of how to store multiple epidemics

n.epi <- 100 ### number of epidemics you want
total.out <- matrix(NA, nrow=10*n.epi,ncol=4) # create output matrix with (10*n.epi) number of rows. Because we know most epidemics end before 8-9 time steps, this should produce too many rows. We'll cut extras out later

j <- 1 ### j is going to be our counter

for (k in 1:n.epi){ ### start a for loop, just like above. k will end up being our 'label' for each epidemic
  alpha <- 0.96
  s0 <- 100 
  i <- 1
  t <- 0
  out <- c(t, s0,i,k)
    while(i>0){
      s <- rbinom(1, s0,alpha^i) #binomial random variable
      i <- s0 - s #calculate i_t+1 from s_t and and s_t+1 
      t <- t+1 #update time vector
      out <- rbind(out, c(t, s,i,k)) # appends the new row of data to the output matrix
      s0 <- s # use s to calculate new number of susceptibles in the simulation
    }

  total.out[j:(j+length(out[,1]) - 1),1:4] <- out ### this code fills the four columns of the total.out matrix
                                                  ### from row j to row (j + the length of the epidemic) 
                                                  ### The - 1 is because we started with j = 1
                                                  ### so if the first epidemic took 7 'days', total.out would fill up from rows 1 to 7.
  
  j <- j + length(out[,1]) ### now we need to update our counter, so we can tell ourselves where
                           ### to start the input of the NEXT epidemic. If the first epidemic took 7 'days',
                           ### j goes from 1 (which we specified at the outset) to 1 + 7 = 8.
                           ### Thus, the next epidemic will be input starting on row 8
}

stoch.epi <- as.data.frame(subset(total.out,!is.na(total.out[,1]))) ### this code removes the NA's still left in total.out (we put extra in because we didn't know how long the matrix would need to be, because each epidemic is stochastic)
colnames(stoch.epi) <- c("time","S","I","ID") ### add the columns
str(stoch.epi) ### str stands for 'structure' and is a very useful command. it tells you what objects are!

mean.epi <- aggregate(stoch.epi$I,by=list(stoch.epi$time),FUN=mean) ### the aggregate command passes a function to your data. Here we get the mean number of infecteds by each time point
colnames(mean.epi) <- c("time","mean.I") ### and label the new object
str(mean.epi)
### plotting

#install.packages("ggplot2") ### I'm bad at base R graphics, which is because/why I use a separate package called ggplot
library(ggplot2) ### install it if you need to, then load

### ggplot2 is a little different than base graphics
### in the first row of the call to 'ggplot', we'll give it a data argument (data =...) and
### what's called an 'aesthetic' or 'aes' argument. This is where we put our x and y variables
### the next inputs are called 'geoms' and stand for geometric objects. There are tons. We'll use
### geom_line() for, you guessed it, lines.

ggplot(data=stoch.epi,aes(x=time,y=I))+ ### enter data, x, y
  geom_line(colour="gray75",aes(group=factor(ID)))+ ### create a separte line for each 'epidemic' ID
  geom_line(data=mean.epi,aes(x=time,y=mean.I),colour="black",size=2)+ ### add another line for the 'mean' we calculated earlier
  #stat_smooth(se=TRUE,type="loess",colour="black",size=2,fill="blue")+ ### see for yourself what this does. it's an example of an alternate object ggplot2 can add
  theme_bw() ### the default ggplot has a grey background; this removes that.

### and here's how to do the same/similar thing with base graphics:
with(stoch.epi,plot(I~time,type="l",col="gray75"))
lines(mean.epi$mean.I~mean.epi$time,type="l",col="black",lwd=3)

### for something like this, there's not too much difference between ggplot2 and base R graphics
### where ggplot can be useful is when you want to split things up by factors, like an experimental treatment or an "id" variable
